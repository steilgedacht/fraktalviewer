# Fraktalviewer

A program to explore fractals like the mandelbrot-set and the corresponding julia-sets.

The main program is the `Fraktalviewer.exe`.
The project was made in Visual Studio, the corresponding project files are in the [/Fraktalviewer](https://github.com/steilgedacht/fraktalviewer/tree/main/Fraktalviewer) directory.

**I made also a couple of explainitory videos:**
